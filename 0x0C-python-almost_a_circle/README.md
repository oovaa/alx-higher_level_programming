# Almost a Circle

## Project Overview

"Almost a Circle" is a Python project that aims to review and consolidate various concepts of Python programming, including object-oriented programming, unit testing, serialization, deserialization, and file I/O operations. The project is structured around creating and manipulating geometric shapes, primarily rectangles and squares, with an emphasis on implementing robust unit tests to ensure code reliability and efficiency.

## Features

- **Base Class**: Serves as the foundation for other classes with common attributes and methods.
- **Rectangle Class**: Inherits from the Base class; represents rectangle objects with additional attributes.
- **Square Class**: Inherits from the Rectangle class; represents square objects, a special case of rectangles.
- **Serialization/Deserialization**: Convert class instances into JSON string representations and vice versa.
- **File I/O**: Read and write objects to and from files in both JSON and CSV formats.
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive test suite to validate the functionality of all methods and classes.
- **Drawing Module**: Utilizes Turtle graphics to visually represent the created shapes.

## Technologies

- Python 3.8.5
- Unit testing with Python's `unittest` framework
- Turtle graphics module for Python

## Setup and Installation

Ensure that you have Python 3.8.5 installed on your system. Clone the repository to your local machine:
